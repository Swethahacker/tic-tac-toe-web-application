# tic-tac-toe-web-application
My Tic Tac Toe game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  HTML provides the structure, laying out the 3x3 grid using a table or divs.  Each cell in the grid represents a potential move and can be interacted with.  CSS styles the game board, including the grid lines, the appearance of the X's and O's, and any hover or active states.
